update command list automatically

gets stuck on bad username when giving points

when Mark put !bankheist £9998 in chat, the json parser lost a single quote? seems weird.
a : in the parameter breaks on jsonparsing in C#
!bankheist •9999 same as above

allow a negative modifier on a roll.

overflowing 32 bit integer breaks client on !give command
(switched to 64 bit. test this again.)
comma in the amount of points breaks the !give command
(retest)

Consider if we can add a website where players can edit stats and weapons and stuff, 
--so then the player types !rollattack and the bot can just sort it out

Maybe roll for saves and whatnot as well, then. !rollconsave to roll a constitution save, for example.

Definitely adding hooks to all the major social medias so you can notify from the bot that you're going live.

!quote "Oh look a penguin!"
!quote 3

(timestamp will work similarly)

!mods
